#### Problem Statement ID â€“ 1584
#### Problem Statement Title- AI based acoustic wave monitoring of rail defects like cracks, fractures and prediction for rail wear, quality along with other parameters. 
#### Theme- Transportation and Logistics
#### PS Category- Software/Hardware - Hardware

#### Description - Acoustic waves are transmitted towards the rail tracks using a transducer or emitter, and a strategically placed sensor array captures the reflected wave patterns, detecting any anomalies such as cracks or wear as the waves interact with defects in the track.
